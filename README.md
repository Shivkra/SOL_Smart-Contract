# SOL_Smart-Contract

üö¶ Choose your path
Getting Solana setup all starts with your machine. If you are running an Intel macOS machine or Linux machine feel free to move right on through. If you are running a Windows machine or M1 macOS machine follow one of the links below:

ü¶Ä Install Rust
In Solana, programs are written in Rust! If you don't know Rust don't worry. As long as you know some other language ‚Äî you'll pick it up over the course of this project.

To install Rust, you can just follow the installation steps here. There are clear steps for getting Rust installed for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Once you're done, verify by doing:

rustup --version
Then, make sure the rust compiler is installed:

rustc --version
Last, let's make sure Cargo is working as well. Cargo is the rust package manager.

cargo --version
As long as all those commands output a version and didn't error, you're good to go!

üî• Install Solana
Solana has a super nice CLI that's going to be helpful later when we want to test the programs we write.

Again, the installation steps are pretty straight forward here. There are clear steps for getting the Solana CLI installed for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Don't worry about upgrading to the latest version of Solana.

Note: Depending on your system ‚Äî once you install Solana, it may output a message like "Please update your PATH environment variable" and it'll give you a line to copy and run. Go ahead and copy + run that command so your PATH gets setup properly.

Once you're done installing, run this to make sure stuff is working:

solana --version
If that output a version number, you're good to go!

Next thing you'll want to do is run these two commands separately:

solana config set --url localhost
solana config get
This will output something like

Config File: /Users/flynn/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: http://localhost:8899
WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:8900/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/flynn/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
This means that Solana is set up to talk to our local network! When developing programs, we're going to be working w/ our local Solana network so we can quickly test stuff on our computer.

The last thing to test is we want to make sure we can get a local Solana node running. Basically, remember how we said that the Solana chain is run by "validators"? Well ‚Äî we can actually set up a validator on our computer to test our programs with.

solana-test-validator
Notes for Windows users
If you are a Windows user and the above command doesn't work, or you get the following error Unable to connect to validator: Client error: test-ledger/admin.rpc does not exist make sure you do the following.

Open WSL instead of Powershell.
Enter the command cd ~/ to get out of the starting directory
Now enter solana-test-validator
This may take a bit to get started but once it's going you should see something like this:

Untitled

Boom!! You're now running a local validator. Pretty cool :).

If you are running an Intel Mac and see the error below you will need to install the OpenSSL library. The easiest way to do this would be through brew like so:  brew install openssl@1.1

solana-gif-portal solana-test-validator
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/<your-username>/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin/solana-test-validator
  Reason: image not found
Now, go ahead and CONTROL + C to stop the validator. We're never going to actually use solana-test-validator manually ourselves again. The workflow we're going to follow will actually automatically run the validator in the background for us. I just wanted to show you it working so you can start getting an idea of how stuff is working magically as we move forward ;).

‚òïÔ∏è Install Node, NPM, and Mocha
Pretty solid chance you already have Node and NPM. When I do node --version I get v16.0.0. The minimum version is v11.0.0. If you don't have node and NPM, get it here.

After that, be sure to install this thing called Mocha. It's a nice little testing framework to help us test our Solana programs.

npm install -g mocha
‚öìÔ∏è The magic of Anchor
We're going to be using this tool called "Anchor" a lot. If you know about Hardhat from the world of Ethereum, it's sorta like that! Except ‚Äî it's built for Solana. Basically, it makes it really easy for us to run Solana programs locally and deploy them to the actual Solana chain when we're ready!

Anchor is a really early project run by a few core devs. You're bound to run into a few issues. Be sure to join the Anchor Discord and feel free to ask questions or create an issue on their Github as you run into issues. The devs are awesome. Maybe even say you're from buildspace in #general on their Discord :).

BTW ‚Äî don't just join their Discord and ask random questions expecting people to help. Try hard yourself to search their Discord to see if anyone else has had the same question you have. Give as much info about your questions as possible. Make people want to help you lol.

Seriously ‚Äî join that Discord, the devs are really helpful.

Installing this thing was a little troublesome for me, but, I got it working via the steps below! We're going to build it from source. Note: If you're on Linux, there are some special instructions you can follow here. Mac and Windows below. Also, if you're using Linux for Windows, follow the Linux commands!

To install Anchor, go ahead an run:

cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor anchor-cli --locked
The above command may take a while. Once it's done, it may ask you to update your path, remember to do that.

From here run:

anchor --version
If you got that working, nice, you have Anchor!!

We'll also use Anchor's npm module and Solana Web3 JS ‚Äî these both will help us connect our web app to our Solana program!

npm install @project-serum/anchor @solana/web3.js
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Create a test project and run it
Okay, we're nearly done haha. The last thing we need to do to finalize installation is to actually run a Solana program locally and make sure it actually works.

Let's start a boilerplate Solana project named myepicproject.

anchor init myepicproject --javascript
cd myepicproject
Notes for windows users
Run the commands using WSL2 and not powershell.
If cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor avm --locked --force gives you errors. Refer to the Anchor user documents. You might need to install the Linux (WSL) dependencies. To do this, run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev
If you get further issues such as error: failed to run custom build command for openssl-sys v0.9.71, run sudo apt install libssl-dev
Once these dependencies have been installed, the command from step 2 should work.
Now set the anchor version with avm use latest and you should be good to go!
anchor init will create a bunch of files/folders for us. It's sorta like create-react-app in a way. We'll check out all the stuff it's created in moment.

If you are running the project locally and don't have yarn installed anchor init will fail. To solve this you can install yarn by running npm install --global yarn .

üîë Create a local keypair
Next thing we need to do is actually generate a local Solana wallet to work with. Don't worry about creating a passphrase for now, just tap "Enter" when it asks.

solana-keygen new
What this will do is create a local Solana keypair ‚Äî which is sorta like our local wallet we'll use to talk to our programs via the command line. If you run solana config get you'll see something called Keypair Path. That's where the wallet has been created, feel free to check it out :).

If you run:

solana address
You'll see the public address of your local wallet we just created.

ü•≥ Let's run our program
When we did anchor init it created a basic Solana program for us. What we want to do now is:

Compile our program.
Spin up solana-test-validator and deploy the program to our local Solana network w/ our wallet. This is kinda like deploying our local server w/ new code.
Actually call functions on our deployed program. This is kinda like hitting a specific route on our server to test that it's working.
Anchor is awesome. It lets us do this all in one step by running:

Note: Be sure you don't have solana-test-validator running anywhere else it'll conflict w/ Anchor. This took me a while to figure out lol.

anchor test
This may take a while the first time you run it! As long as you get the green words at the bottom that say "1 passing" you're good to go!! Keep us posted in the Discord if you run into issues here.

Untitled

Note: If you receive the message node: --dns-result-order= is not allowed in NODE_OPTIONS this mean you are on an older version of Node and technically, this didn't pass! Since I tested this all with Node v16.13.0 I would highly suggest you just upgrade to this version. Upgrading node is a pain, learn more here. I like using nvm.

Note: If you get this message Error: Your configured rpc port: 8899 is already in use and you do not have application which is listenning to port 8899, try to run solana-test-validator, and in the next terminal tab anchor test --skip-local-validator. It should run fine.

Congrats you've successfully set up your Solana environment :). It's been quite the journey, but, we made it fam.
